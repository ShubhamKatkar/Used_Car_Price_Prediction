# Used_Car_Price_Prediction
The focus of this project is on developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used
car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. We implemented different regression algorithms and
evaluated various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sales price of different manufacturers and models
across different cities. Our result shows the score obtained by different models and selects the one which gives the
best result for prediction.
